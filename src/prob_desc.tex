\section{Problem Description}

The SH17 dataset contains 8,099 annotated images with 75,994 instances across 17 classes. 
From these classes, we aim to to develop a detection model for just the person class.
The model will use a SVM classifier to classify features extracted with the HOG method as a person or not a person.

The performance of the model will be evaluated using the benchmarks described in the SH-17 paper, including precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our model's performance will then be compared to benchmarks obtained in the SH17 paper for the YOLO8, YOLO9, and YOLO10 architectures.
