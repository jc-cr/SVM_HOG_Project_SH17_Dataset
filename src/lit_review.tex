\section{Literature Review}

Object detection from images involves two tasks: object classification and object locating. 
Both of these tasks involve the extraction of meaningful features from an image. 
Various techniques exists in literature to determine feature sets from an image.

% Feature extraciton

This paper uses the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method which captures local gradient structures from images (1467360).
Other approaches to extracting features include Scale-Invariant Feature Transform and Speeded Up Robust Features algorithms.

% Classification

Once features have been extracted from an image various options exists for then using those features to make a prediction on new data. 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) have commonly been used for this tasks as their able to efficiently classify higher dimensional data through the use of space transformations. 

For a similar task of face detection, AdaBoost proved to be an effective method.
