\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we compared traditional machine learning approaches to more modern deep learning methods for person detection in images.
A linear SVM classifier with a SGD optimizer was chosen in this case, as linear SVM have previously been used in many successful applications of person object detection.
Features from the images were extracted using the HOG approach.

The final model performed extremely poorly when evaluated using the same metrics as the SH17 paper.
From the evaluation, it was observed that the model's predictions would fall below the 0.5 IoU threshold, which is the minimum threshold for a detection to be considered a true positive.
Thus more work is needed to improve the model's performance which could be accomplished with improved prediction window merging and hyperparameter tuning.
