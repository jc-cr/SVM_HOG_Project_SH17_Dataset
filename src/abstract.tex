\section{Abstract}

This paper implements and evaluates a traditional computer vision approach to object detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification on a modern industrial safety dataset. 
The SH17 dataset, containing 8,099 annotated images with 75,994 instances across 17 classes, is used to train and evaluate a person detector.
A linear SVM with stochastic gradient descent optimization is implemented, processing 64,990 total features from 10,920 positive and 54,070 negative samples. 
The model's performance is evaluated using COCO metrics and compared against modern YOLO architectures trained on the same dataset. 
While the HOG-SVM approach achieved limited performance (mAP50: 1.1\%, mAP50-95: 1.0\%) compared to deep learning methods (best mAP50: 70.9\%, mAP50-95: 48.7\%), analysis of the detection boxes reveals that predictions tend to fall within ground truth areas, suggesting potential for improvement through enhanced post-processing and parameter tuning.
